# Overview
FusedChat is an inter-mode dialogue dataset. It contains dialogue sessions fusing task-oriented dialogues (TOD) and open-domain dialogues (ODD). Based on [MultiWOZ](https://github.com/smartyfh/MultiWOZ2.4), FusedChat appends or prepends an ODD to every existing TOD. See more details in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04137.pdf).
